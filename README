Building a time registration app based on node.js, mongo, and backbone in the client.

Based on e-conomic/NodeMongoBoiler


TODO:

- how to model date and time-intervals in a good way?
-- should each registration be seperate document (and use map-reduce to find for a given day) - or a document for a day

-- breaktime should be part of day...
-- timeregs should be added to a day
